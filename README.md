This project is part of the IBM Applied Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone

The final report can be found [here](https://github.com/EricYangg/IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/report/IBM%20Capstone%20-%20SpaceX.pdf)

## Summary
- Constructed a full data science pipeline using Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn) for the SpaceX Falcon 9 launches, encompassing data acquisition (SpaceX API and Web Scraping) and feature engineering. 
- Developed and optimized classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree) to predict first-stage landing success, achieving the highest accuracy with the Decision Tree model.
- Engineered an interactive analytics dashboard using Plotly Dash to visualize success rates by launch site and payload mass, and utilized Folium for geographical analysis of sites.
